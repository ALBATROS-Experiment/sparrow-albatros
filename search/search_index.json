The first is to house and version control embedded software that runs on the Sparrow's ARM's processor. The second is to house and version control gateware that runs on the Sparrow's FPGA. The third is to store and checkpoint disk-images of the OS that run the data acquisition software. The embedded software mates with the gateware, so it's conveniant to track them in the same repository. We use git-lfs to track the OS disk-images and exclude them from downloading by default. By tracking disk images here we we can recreate a bit-accurate release of sparrow-albatros without relying on anything outside of this repository.

Quick start You have all the hardware for a Sparrow-Albatros data acquisition system and you want to get the software up and running for data collection. Easy, just download the latest image from os-sd-images directory , unzip it, and write it onto a fresh SD card. :warning: To save time writing the image we shrink the main filesystem partition. If the image hasn't automatically resized, make sure to resize the partition so that it takes up the full disk space. To do this: - Insert the SD card into a linux machine or computer - If it auto-mounts, unmount it - Open gparted - Select the SD card volume - Resize the filesystem partition \"rootfs\" so that it takes up the full remaining disk space (click on it and drag the arrow so that the partition takes up all the remaining empty space) - Click \"Apply all operations\" Now you're ready to run the data acquisition software.","title":"Installing Sparrow Albatros"},{"location":"installing-sparrow-albatros/#quick-start","text":"You have all the hardware for a Sparrow-Albatros data acquisition system and you want to get the software up and running for data collection.
