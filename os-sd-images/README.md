Images of the sd card, tracked and version controlled with [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/). 

To pull the repository without any of the large files tracked here just use git as you usually would. If you want to fetch one of the large files (which you should never do in the sparrow system) install git lfs (e.g. on mac it's `brew install git-lfs`), then figure out which file you want to pull and pull it using the lfs extension, e.g. `git lfs pull --include="path/to/large/image/file.zip"`.
