We're running Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver) on the Sparrow's ARM processor. 

## Quick start

You have all the hardware for a Sparrow-Albatros data acquisition system and you want to get the software up and running for data collection. Easy, just download the latest image from [os-sd-images directory](https://github.com/ALBATROS-Experiment/sparrow-albatros/tree/main/os-sd-images), unzip it, and write it onto a fresh SD card. 

:warning: To save time writing the image we shrink the main filesystem partition. If the image hasn't automatically resized, make sure to resize the partition so that it takes up the full disk space. To do this:
- Insert the SD card into a linux machine or computer
- If it auto-mounts, unmount it
- Open gparted
- Select the SD card volume
- Resize the filesystem partition "rootfs" so that it takes up the full remaining disk space (click on it and drag the arrow so that the partition takes up all the remaining empty space)
- Click "Apply all operations"

Now you're ready to run the data acquisition software.
