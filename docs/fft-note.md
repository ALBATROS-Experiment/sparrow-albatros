# A Note on CASPER's FFT Implementation

## What is a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

- DFT, explain it as a matrix

## Radix-2 Decomposition

- Derive the Radix-2 decomposition from matrices

## Pipelining

- explain how FFTs are usually optimized

## Biplexing

- xyz 

## FFT Shift Schedule

- What is the shift schedule. Link to how to program it in other document. 
- What is the trade off in terms of resources etc.

## Bit Growth

- takes up more resources but at least doesn't raise the noise floor

## Symmetric Group Buffering

- xyz cite Aaron Parson's symetric group paper and optimization
