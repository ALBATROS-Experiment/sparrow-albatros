# Sparrow Albatros 

This repository serves three purpouses. The first is to house and version control **embedded software** that runs on the Sparrow's ARM's processor. The second is to house and version control **gateware** that runs on the Sparrow's FPGA. The third is to store and checkpoint **disk-images** of the OS that run the data acquisition software. The embedded software mates with the gateware, so it's conveniant to track them in the same repository. We use git-lfs to track the OS disk-images and exclude them from downloading by default. By tracking disk images here we we can recreate a bit-accurate release of sparrow-albatros without relying on anything outside of this repository. 

## Embedded software
We're running Ubunto on the on the Zynq's ARM core. The software that runs on this processor controls. This software can be found in the /software directory. Everything in this repository that runs on the ARM core comes from this directory.
