Compiled with mlib devel changes pulled that make Sparrow's ARM do Eth through SFP3 instead of RJ45 port, which has a hardware bug that JH warns could suddenly kill our eth connection (which would be costly in money and data). 

No changes from previous version (which included FFT bit growth), see docs and previous logs for deets.
